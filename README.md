# Flashcard-App
A simple command-line flashcard app built with Python.
You can create, edit, or delete flashcards and start study sessions, using a spaced repetition-like system.

## Features

- Create a new flashcard with front and back text
- Edit or delete existing flashcards
- Start session with:
  - Card flipping (front / back)
  - Card difficulty rating (easy / medium / hard)
  - Spaced repetition logic
- Flashcards stored in a JSON file

## Technologies
- Python 3
- JSON for data storage
- Command-line interface

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
| git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
| cd your-repo-name
2. Run the app
| python main.py

## Todo (Coming soon)
- GUI using Tkinter
- Improve session logic in general
- Add user stats (how many cards studied, accuracy, etc.)
- Tagging / Categories for cards

## Why I Made this?
Because I'm learning Python, and even though it seemed complex at the beginning,
I knew building this project would help improve my understanding of program structure, logic, and data handling.
